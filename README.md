# Graph-Coloring
This is a topic from the field of graph theory in which we color the elements of the graph i.e. the vertices and the edges(vertex coloring and edge coloring) in a particular fashion. 
A proper coloring of a graph or vertex coloring is an assignment of labels or colors to each vertex of a graph such that no edge connects two identically colored vertices.
The most common type of vertex coloring seeks to minimize the number of colors for a given graph. 
Such a coloring is known as a minimum vertex coloring, and the minimum number of colors which with the vertices of a graph G may be colored is called the chromatic number.

In an undirected graph, a conflict-free coloring is an assignment of colors to the vertices of the graph G such that every vertex in G has a uniquely colored vertex in its neighborhood. 
The conflict-free coloring problem asks to find the smallest number of colors required for a conflict-free coloring.
This problem was first introduced in 2002 by Even, Lotker, Ron and Smorodinsky. The conflict-free coloring problem is NP-complete. 
In graph theory, an interval graph is an undirected graph formed from a set of intervals on the real line, with a vertex for each interval and an edge between vertices whose intervals intersect. 
It is the intersection graph of the intervals.
I used randomly generated interval graphs to find chromatic number of conflict-free coloring in simple planar graphs of open neighbourhood by using a order-oriented approach.
